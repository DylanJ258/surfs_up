# surfs_up
## Overview
W. Avy likes your original analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Resources
* Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook
* Data: hawaii.sqlite
## Results
* June
  * Count = 1700
  * Mean = 74.94
  * std = 3.26
  * min = 64.00
  * max = 85.00
  * <img width="149" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-26 at 6 29 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104036750/175837993-981bdbad-f80c-488a-bf97-e3ee5eab7b51.png">

* December
  * Count = 1517
  * Mean = 71.04
  * std = 3.75
  * min = 56.00
  * max = 83.00
  * <img width="150" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-26 at 6 31 43 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104036750/175838069-ec5afce8-3d6f-4b78-9b63-1542aeda09ab.png">
  
* The mean temperature doesn’t vary much, with the mean for June being about 75 and the mean for December being about 71. The mean for these two months only differ by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The high temperatures also don't differ much, with the high for June being about 85 and the high for December being about 83. The highs for these two months only differ by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The low temperatures show the most difference, with the low for June being about 64 and the low for December being about 56. The low for these two months differ by about 8 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The standard deviations are also fairly similar, with June being about 3.26 and December being about 3.75. December has slighly more unpredicatble weather but again, it isn't an alarming difference.
## Summary
* Overall, the weather in June does not vary much from the weather in December. The most significant difference is seen between the lows of June and December, but it isn't anything drastic. Therefore, there are no obvious signs that the shop should adjust when they are open due to what time of the year it is. 
* An additional querie to consider might be precipitation. While the time of the year in regards to temparutre doesn’t seem like it will affect the shop much, the amount of rain might. If we had additional data on the amount of precipitation during certain times of the year we may be able to determine whether or not the shops hours should be adjusted.
* Another additional querie to consider might be tourism. If we had additional data on the amount of tourism during certain times of the year we may be able to determine whether or not the shops hours should be adjusted.
